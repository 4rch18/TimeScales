TimeScales documentation
************************


This is the documentarion of the TimeScales framework, which is used to 
run a Multiscale Model of the Medium Spiny Neuron of the Neostriatum, 
integrating electrical signalling with biochemical pathways.

The main script to launch the simulation is `spinesIntegration.py`, which 
accepts a certain amount of parameters.

The code is licensed under BSD.

The TimeScales framework
************************

This is the README of the TimeScales framework, which is used to 
run a Multiscale Model of the Medium Spiny Neuron of the Neostriatum, 
integrating electrical signalling with biochemical pathways.

The main script to launch the simulation is spinesIntegration.py, which 
accepts a certain amount of parameters (described in the source code).

The code is licensed under BSD.
